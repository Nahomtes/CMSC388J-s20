# Building Secure Web Applications with Python and Flask

![Flask Logo][logo]

This course is an introduction to building secure, full-stack web applications with Python
and Flask. We'll start with Python and Flask, and then subsequent weeks will cover
how to add Flask extensions to your applications to implement common web app functionalities, how
to protect your website from bad actors, and more! At the end of the course, you'll be able to deploy your app for the world to see.

* See **Fluid Schedule** section below

## Fluid Schedule

Weeks 7 and 14 will have a main topic of discussion, but during these weeks, we'll also try
to teach topics requested by the students. So if you guys feel like you need more info about a
certain topic during class, or just want to learn a new idea altogether, let us know, and
we'll try to add it in.

We'll send out information on how you can let us know anonymously; surveys
will probably be conducted anonymously on ELMS.

## Grading

Grades will be maintained on ELMS.
You will be responsible for all material discussed in lecture as well as other standard means of communication
(Piazza, email announcements, etc.), including but not limited to deadlines, policies, assignment changes, etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
percentages:

| Percentage | Title         | Description                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 60%        | Projects      | Weekly projects to test knowledge of topics taught in class |
| 40%        | Final Project | Final project - creating app from scratch                   |

Any request for reconsideration of any grading on coursework must be submitted
within one week of when it is returned. No requests will be considered
afterwards.

## Projects

The project is due the day it is scheduled to be due, barring any extensions that may be given out. 
They will be due at 11:59 PM. Not all of
the projects will have tests; they will be graded according to a rubric 
which will also be provided. All projects must be submitted online on ELMS.

Project weighting will be determined at a later time.

**Late Policy**: Projects may be submitted up to three days late for 10% off your earned grade, 
**each day**. After this, no more projects will be accepted.
The highest score you get on the project, counting late and on-time submissions, will be your grade 
for that project. There are **no exceptions**
unless you've talked with us beforehand or provide a valid excuse.

We will look at your most recent on-time and late (if applicable) submissions when grading.

## Final project

The final project will use everything you have learned in class before and will require you
to build a Flask web application from scratch with a group or individually, and deploy
the app on a hosting platform. Requirements for the final project will come out
towards the end of the semester.

## Outside-of-class communication with course staff
We'll communicate through students mainly through Piazza and through office hours.

**Office hours**: Thursdays, 2-3 PM, AVW 1120

Please use Piazza as your primary communication with the course staff, we'll get back to you
the quickest on Piazza. If you absolutely cannot use Piazza, then email us; if you are
emailing Yashas or Kenton, make sure to CC the other. **Additionally**, please include
`[CMSC 388J]` at the start of your subject line so we don't accidentally ignore your email.

## Academic Integrity
Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and
plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic
dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all
submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to
the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the
[Office of Student Conduct](http://osc.umd.edu/OSC/Default.aspx).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating,
fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of
Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit

forget to provide your feedback using the campus-wide CourseEvalUM system. Your
